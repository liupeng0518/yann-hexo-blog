Learn to love the command line. Leave the IDE behind.
## 学习并热爱命令行，远离IDE
因为许多原因比如git subcommands这些命令，总是希望可以拥抱命令行。Git极具威力，IDE显然也是，但侧重在不同的方向上，我每天都使用IDE(IntelliJ IDEA)也使用一些额外的选择(Eclipse)，但是我从未见过有IDE将Git集成比命令行本身更强大的。（建立在你了解Git命令）


For as many reasons as there are git subcommands, it's wise to embrace the command line. Git is insanely powerful; IDEs are too, but each in different ways. I use an IDE every day (IntelliJ IDEA) and have used others extensively (Eclipse), but I have never seen IDE integration for git that could begin to match the ease and power of the command line (once you know it).

Certain git-related IDE functions are invaluable, like calling git rm when you delete a file, and doing the right stuff with git when you rename one. Where everything falls apart is when you start trying to commit, merge, rebase, or do sophisticated history analysis through the IDE.

When it comes to wielding the full power of git, it's command-line all the way.

Remember that whether you use Bash or Z shell, there are tab completion scripts that take much of the pain out of remembering the subcommands and switches.
